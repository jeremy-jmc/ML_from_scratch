The motivation to work in this repository along this year is accomplish over 50% of the algorithms mentioned in this [blog](https://terenceshin.medium.com/all-machine-learning-algorithms-you-should-know-for-2023-843dba11419c).

This repository is the version2 of this [repo](https://github.com/jeremy-jmc/ML_Algorithms/).

## **Hypothesis**

A machine learning `hypothesis` is a candidate model that approximates a target function for mapping input to outputs.

## **Cost Function vs. Loss Functions**

`Cost function` is a function that measures the performance of a ML model for given data, is basically the calculation of the error between predicted values and expected values. `Cost Function` is the average of error of n-sample in the data and `Loss Function` is the error for individual data points.

## **Gradient Descent**

Is an optimization algorithm used to find the values of parameters(coefficients) of a function that minimizes a cost function.

This algorithm minimize the error of some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient vector


## **Learning rate**

The learning rate is a tuning parameter in an optimization algorithm that determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a cost function
